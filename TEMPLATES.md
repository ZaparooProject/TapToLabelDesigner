# Templates format

Templates are SVG.
The SVG [format](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/) is very flexible, SVGs come in many forms and shape and support a lot of features.
The Zaparoo designer does not support any SVG feature. Zaparoo designer uses FabricJS to parse and render templates on a canvas and export them on a printable PDF, and so it inherits all the FabricJS limitations.
